Recommendation Algorithm
The movie recommendation system uses a content-based filtering approach to generate recommendations. The algorithm works as follows:

Preprocess the dataset by extracting relevant features from the movies, such as genre, keywords, and cast.
Compute the similarity between each pair of movies using a similarity metric, such as cosine similarity.
Given a user's preferences, calculate the similarity between the user's preferred movies and all other movies in the dataset.
Sort the movies based on their similarity to the user's preferences and recommend the top-rated movies.
Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the movie recommendation system:

Input your favorite movie genres, keywords, or actors/actresses, and the system will recommend similar movies.
Specify a particular movie, and the system will suggest movies that are similar in terms of genre, keywords, or cast.
Rate a set of movies, and the system will recommend movies that have high similarity to your rated movies.
